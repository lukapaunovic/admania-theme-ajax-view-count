# admania-theme-ajax-view-count
As Admania theme lacked AJAX View Count feature when caching is enabled, I developed it because many of my clients are using it and they need caching because of high traffic.

# Instructions

1. Place the footer.php content before the body tag in /wp-content/themes/admania/footer.php
2. Place ajax-view-count.php in /wp-content/themes/admania/
3. Done, your admania view count now works with caching!
