# admania-theme-ajax-view-count
As Admania theme lacked the feature of performing Ajax-View count while caching is enabled, I developed this feature because many of my clients are high-traffic sites using this theme.

#Instructions

1. Place the footer.php content before the </body> tag in /wp-content/themes/admania/footer.php
2. Place ajax-view-count.php in /wp-content/themes/admania/
3. Done, your admania view count now works with caching!
